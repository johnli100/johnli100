- 👋 Hi, my name is John Li.
- 👀 I’m an Economist, Actuary, Machine learning practitioner and Vipassana meditator.  
- 🌱 I am deeply awed by the beauty and simplicity, complexity and chaos that co-exist in this world. I rely on statistics (especially Bayesian), Causal modeling, Complexity Science and Machine Learning to understand how everything works. However, I believe knowledge through direct experience often times triumphs over knowledge through conceptualization! 
- 💞️ I’m currently experimenting the use of Causal modeling and Machine learning for trading/investing.
