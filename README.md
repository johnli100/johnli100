- 👋 Hi, my name is John Li.
- 👀 I’m an economist by training and I currently work as an actuary quantifying risks using stochastic models.
- 🌱 I am deeply awed by the vast beauty and simplicity, complexity and chaos that co-exist in this world. I try to use Causality, Complexity Science, Bayesian statistics and Machine Learning to help me understand how everything works. However, I believe direct experience rather than knowledge (by way of conceptualization) of the real world is the best way to understand it, live it! 
- 💞️ I’m experimenting the use of Machine Learning especially Causal AI for trading/investing.
